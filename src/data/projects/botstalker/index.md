## Summary

Botstalker is a simple web app which lets you monitor your bots direct message channels with other users. Enter your bot's API key and select a user. This allows you to easily debug messages your bot might be sending other users. I build this tool after discovering a slack bot I create had been messaging _a lot_ more than expected - it turns out he was chatting away with Slackbot!

## Features

- Completely clientside
- View all the channels or people your bot is talking in
- Simpler and easier to use than adding console logs to your bot code

## Open Source

Botstalker is released under the MIT licence and can be found [here on Github](https://github.com/Weetbix/botstalker-react).
