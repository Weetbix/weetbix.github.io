Lepus is experimental multiplayer LAN game created in 48 hours for [GGJ](http://globalgamejam.org/) 2014. Described as a mad fun cat and mouse game which is all about a difference in perception.

### What is Global Game Jam?

> The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is the world's largest game jam event (game creation) taking place around the world at physical locations. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today’s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games – it is very universal.

### The Challenge

Over 40 developers and artists split into groups and spent 48 hours hacking away in a non-descript building in the suburbs of Perth. Our goal? To produce a game based on the 2014 GGJ theme:

_We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are._

When players enter the Lepus world they play as either the _Chaser_ or the _Chasee_

The _Chaser's_ perception of the world is a bright, playful and postive experience. They spent their time roaming around a well lit forrest trying to catch fuzzy bunny rabbits with their brand new net. They must try to bag as many carrot-throwing-fuzz-balls as possible before the time runs out.

The _Chasee's_ seem to play as the bunny rabbits, eagerly trying to avoid life as a pet shop prize. The dark truth is revealed post game when the players share their experiences with eachother. The players being chased experience the world as a dark and frightening woods, desperately trying to run away from an axe wielding murderer.

You can find the game at our [Global Game Jam Page](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/lepus).
