## Summary

Next Beer is a simple pub crawling app with one rule: **You MUST visit the bar**.

Skipping is not allowed unless you are near the bar!

Next Beer is built with modern Javascript using React Native, Redux and Expo. It allows would-be pub crawlers to get and running with just one click. When you start you are given a local bar that you must walk to, direction are displayed on screen. In order to skip the bar or move on, you must be within a few meters from the bar. When you move on to new bars, your old bars will be visible on the map.
