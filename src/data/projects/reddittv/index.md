## Summary

Reddit TV is a free and open source Android TV app for browsing and playing videos. Written in modern Javascript using React Native and MobX.

The development of this in React Native is currently blocked by a few issues relating to RN support on android TV devices. These issues make it impossible to create an android TV app in react native that follows basic navigational standards of the TV platform.

## Open Source

Reddit TV is released under the MIT licence and can be found [here on Github](https://github.com/Weetbix/reddit-tv).
