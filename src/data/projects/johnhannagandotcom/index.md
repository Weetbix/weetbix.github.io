## Summary

My personal website and portfolio (you're on it now!).

This is a statically generated site build with React, Typescript, Gatsby and GraphQL. All data for the site is created as JSON, markdown or YAML, and is transformed at build time to create static pages which are deployed to github pages.

## Features

- Fully static site built with GatsbyJS
- Cypress.io used for end to end tests
- GitHub actions for CI/CD which:
  - Runs E2E tests
  - Deploys on new pushes to the `source` branch

## Open Source

This site is released under the MIT licence and can be found [here on Github](https://github.com/Weetbix/weetbix.github.io).
