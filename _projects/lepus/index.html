    Lepus is experimental multiplayer LAN game created in 48 hours for <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">GGJ</a> 2014. 
    Described as a mad fun cat and mouse game which is all about a difference in perception.

  <h3>What is Global Game Jam?</h3>
  <blockquote cite="http://globalgamejam.org/about">
    The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is the world's largest game jam event (game creation) taking place around the world at physical locations. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today’s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games – it is very universal.</blockquote>
  
  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    Over 40 developers and artists split into groups and spent 48 hours hacking away in a non-descript building in the suburbs of Perth. Our goal? To produce a game based on the 2014 GGJ theme:
  </p>
  <div class="message text-center"><em>We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.</em></div>
  
  <p>
    When players enter the Lepus world they play as either the <em>Chaser</em> or the <em>Chasee</em>
  </p>
  <p>
  The <em>Chaser's</em> perception of the world is a bright, playful and postive experience. They spent their time roaming around a well lit forrest trying to catch fuzzy bunny rabbits with their brand new net. They must try to bag as many carrot-throwing-fuzz-balls as possible before the time runs out.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <em>Chasee's</em> seem to play as the bunny rabbits, eagerly trying to avoid life as a pet shop prize. The dark truth is revealed post game when the players share their experiences with eachother. The players being chased experience the world as a dark and frightening woods, desperately trying to run away from an axe wielding murderer.
