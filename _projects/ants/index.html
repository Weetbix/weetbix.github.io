  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>This is a programmable ant simulator. Each ant can collect food, bring food back to their ant hole, fight other
    ants, flee and so on.</p>

  <p>This was created for ICT219 (Intelligent Systems) in semester 2, 2009. The project requirements were
    very open ended, we had to create an AI based project.</p>

  <p>I decided to make an ant based AI project, in the style of Sim Ant, and to compare different social strategies
    of ants to determine the best social strategy for the particular environment the ants were in. However, I also wanted
    to create a programmable game (similar to Guntactyx).</p> 

  <p>I decided to use Lua as an embedded scripting language for the ants AI. This means the user can extend the game and
    create their own ant AI to battle against other ants.</p>

  <p>Because I wanted it to be a programmable game, I haven't completely handed control over to Lua, because I wouldn't
    want the users programming unfair ants which move at super speeds. So in order to move and pickup food, and other
    actions which interact with the world, the Lua files call certain C++ functions which impose restrictions. All
    communication between other entities (attacking, finding closest ants, finding distance to an ant, picking up food etc)
    needs to be requested through an entity management system ran on the C++ side.</p>

  <p>
    I had these goals when creating my project:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare the social strategy of ant colonies to find the optimal strategy</li>
    <li>Learn to program using Lua</li>
    <li>Learn to expose an interface to Lua</li>
    <li>Experiment with using an embeddable scripting language (Lua) to control the AI</li>
    <li>Create an extremely flexible programmable game</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>AI ants controlled by Lua</li>
    <li>Fully user programmable and extendable</li>
    <li>Comes with 4 types of ants (food collectors, aggressive ants, soldiers and mixed)</li>
    <li>Lua used to build and setup the worlds. This means users can easily create their own scenarios</li>
    <li>Changable time scale. Fast battles or slow!</li>
    <li>Simulations are scored. See which ants are more successful!</li>
  </ul>
