  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>GravityBot is a 3D, gravity based puzzle-platformer. The user plays as a robot who is undergoing intense simulation training to determine the robots job in the real world. The AI for the robot character is created by cloning human brain matter from an
    intelligent being, and the simulation training is to test how pure the sample is. The goal
    of the game is to navigate through a series of levels, collecting coins and avoiding obstacles.
    One of the main game elements is the ability to change the direction of gravity to help navigate
    through complex puzzles.</p>
