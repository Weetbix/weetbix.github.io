  <h3>Summary</h3>

    <img src="award.png" /><span>This project was awarded The WA Industry Selected Games Design and Programming Prize on 31/12/2009</span>

  <p>A fun, old-school styled racing game where the aim is to power slide! This project was completed for ICT207 (Games Design and Programming) 
    in Semester 2, 2009.</p>

  <p>It was a 2-part assignment, part one involved extending the Bush Court area of the 3D world
    which had already been created by another person. We had to model the Tavern section of the
    university and the closest wall to the Tavern. It also involved creating the world where our game
    is set, and the transition between the two worlds. The second assignment involved implementing the
    rest of the Minicar Madness game.</p>

  <p>The project also involved the extension, encapsulation and management of old, poor quality code. For example the
    main.c file was over 5000 lines long and consisted of hundreds of #defines.</p>
