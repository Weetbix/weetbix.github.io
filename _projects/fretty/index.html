<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I was selected to complete a paid 10 week internship/scholarship for <a href="http://www.ivec.org/">iVEC</a>,
  working with <strong>Associate Professor Ben Corry</strong> at UWA. My Project involved
  working with Ben to develop a new method for <strong>optical microscopy</strong> using <strong>image
  analysis and Java</strong>. The result of this internship is Fretty, my <strong>open source</strong> ImageJ
  plugin written in Java.</p>

<p>Fretty performs 2D and 3D deconvolution of FRET Images
  for research purposes.</p>

<p>2D and 3D deconvolution allows you to determine the distance between fluorescent molecules separated by less than 10 nm.
  This is done by using a technique called Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), and then performing 2D and 3D spectral
  deconvolution on the samples gathered (for more information, download the presentation pdf).</p>

<h3>What Fretty Does</h3>
<p>The problem with the above method is that it results in the collection of a large number of microscope images which have
  to be collectively analysed. The aim of Fretty is to ease this process. Fretty is a plugin I developed for <a href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>
  (A popular microscopy tool) which provides the user with a way to very easily perform this analysis.</p>

<p>As part of the internship I also presented my project at a research forum, you may see the presentation file in the downloads section.</p>

<h3>Open Source</h3>
<p>Fretty is released under the LGPL licence and can be found on github:</p>
