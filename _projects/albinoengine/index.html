  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>The Albino Engine is a high level C++ and Lua game engine which renders hardware accelerated 3D graphics.
    The engine has many features but one of the strongest is being completely exposed to Lua. This allows users
    to create entire projects using the Albino Engine and Lua, without touching any C++ code.</p>
  
  <p>
    This is one of the projects I am most proud of because of the amount of effort we put in and the final result. 
  </p>

  <p>The goal of this project was to create a game engine and an accompanying game which shows off the engine. 
    This project was created for ICT311 (Advanced Games Design and Programming) in semester 1, 2010.</p>

  <p>The result is the Albino Engine and a team-based hover tank game called Cantankerous</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Engine completely bound to Lua (lets you create games using only Lua)</li>
    <li>Abstract rendering interface allows multiple graphics APIs for rendering (Only has an OpenGL Implementation though)</li>
    <li>Material System for multi-texturing and pixel shaders</li>
    <li>Scene graph
      <ul>
        <li>Component based (similar to Unity)</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Terrain
      <ul>
        <li>On the fly LOD generation using a combination of Geometry Mipmapping and Tesselation</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Entities and AI
      <ul>
        <li>Entity system which allows users to easily extend a base entity class using either C++ or Lua</li>
        <li>Base entities have a unique ID and a state machine instance</li>
        <li>State machine system allows users to easily extend and create new states for entities using Lua</li>
        <li>Inter-agent messaging system</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>MD2 Key frame animation</li>
    <li>Math classes such as 2D and 3D vectors, matrices and quaternions</li>
    <li>Supports many file formats
      <ul>
        <li>3ds Max 3DS ( .3ds )</li>
        <li>Wavefront Object ( .obj )</li>

  <h3>Cantankerous</h3>

  <p>Cantankerous is the showcase game we created to display the features and power of the Albino Engine.
    It is a team-based hover tank game, black tanks versus red tanks.</p>

  <p>It was written entirely in Lua and is roughly 1100 lines of code.</p>
