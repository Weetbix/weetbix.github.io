Described as a mad fun cat and mouse game which is all about a difference in perception.</p>\n<h2>What is Global Game Jam?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is the world's largest game jam event (game creation) taking place around the world at physical locations. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today’s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games – it is very universal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Challenge</h2>\n<p>Over 40 developers and artists split into groups and spent 48 hours hacking away in a non-descript building in the suburbs of Perth. Our goal? To produce a game based on the 2014 GGJ theme:</p>\n<p><em>We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.</em></p>\n<p>When players enter the Lepus world they play as either the <em>Chaser</em> or the <em>Chasee</em></p>\n<p>The <em>Chaser's</em> perception of the world is a bright, playful and postive experience. They spent their time roaming around a well lit forrest trying to catch fuzzy bunny rabbits with their brand new net. They must try to bag as many carrot-throwing-fuzz-balls as possible before the time runs out.</p>\n<p>The <em>Chasee's</em> seem to play as the bunny rabbits, eagerly trying to avoid life as a pet shop prize. The dark truth is revealed post game when the players share their experiences with eachother. The players being chased experience the world as a dark and frightening woods, desperately trying to run away from an axe wielding murderer.</p>\n<p>You can find the game at our <a href=\"http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/lepus\">Global Game Jam Page</a>.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Built in 48 hours with Love, Sweat, Coffee</li>\n<li>Multiplayer LAN fun</li>\n<li>AI controlled bunnies, for when your friends don't wanna play</li>\n<li>Chiptune music, produced using an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_music\">original GameBoy</a></li>\n</ul>","details":{"caption":"Global Game Jam 2014","category":"Other","date":"2014-1-1","dateVisual":"2014","languages":"C#","libraries":"Unity","summary":null,"team":"Me, Ben Schroeder, Craig Lonsdale, Elliot Bulmer, Nick Ballantyne, Zac Vucemillo","video_url":null,"title":"Lepus"},"fields":{"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMB/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAGsbSic5VZ7cSZxA9//xAAcEAACAwADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAACAwABEQQQITH/2gAIAQEAAQUCjfV5nTPmxYDY8kaFW3P/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAf/aAAgBAwEBPwEh/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIQEf/aAAgBAgEBPwFTb//EABkQAAEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEBEgMf/aAAgBAQAGPwK2IwG//8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERITFBUWH/2gAIAQEAAT8h4m8CSStkqIbjwhdZ0NNk5drG9E5Vj7H/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEEPI/f/EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQETFh/9oACAEDAQE/EADerFX/xAAYEQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABARIf/aAAgBAgEBPxBYjCcOV//EAB0QAQADAQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQWFRcdH/2gAIAQEAAT8Q5YINwgqUaanuOIU+pRVpXgnCJVgKeEtZL9M3+XVvzBuCJ06wT+Cf/9k=","width":114,"height":114,"src":"/static/749260b91b7412b7046582e5476198e1/f5c80/thumb.jpg","srcSet":"/static/749260b91b7412b7046582e5476198e1/f5c80/thumb.jpg 1x,\n/static/749260b91b7412b7046582e5476198e1/b1660/thumb.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/749260b91b7412b7046582e5476198e1/1af49/thumb.jpg 2x"}}},"screenshots":[{"publicURL":"/static/7f1cf27db0cffbc9b3c42a36641bb4f8/lepus_1.png"},{"publicURL":"/static/b8b28151f1d507a417f7e250beaad519/lepus_2.png"}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/lepus/"}}}
