I met pan in sapa where we had agreed yesterday, and we began our 5 hour trek to her village. I spent 2 incredible days with pan walking through the mountains, learning about hmong culture and other minorities living in the mountains.

Pan is only 17 years old, a little shy and very smart. She has been married for 1 year, and has moved to her husband's village, not far from her home village. She speaks English quite well, and Viet and hmong, although she cannot read or write English, and can only read a small amount of Viet, because she has been working since she was as very young on her families rice fields she did not have time for school.

The fist day trekking to her village was through the small and difficult trails, up steep muddy cimbs, across small rice field walls, which at points had me exhausted and never seemed to phase pan, even though she was doing it all in sandals without drinking any water

We stopped at about 1pm at parents house in her mother's village where I met her brothers and sisters and she cooked me lunch, noodles and tomatoes. Cooked in a big cast iron wok in a fire pit lit by bamboo inside the house.
During the trek I mentioned cho cho, as it turns out cho cho is pans dad's brothers wife (pans aunty?) and she new cho cho quite well. We left her parents village and continued to hers, pointing out cho chos house along the way. Cho cho was apparent doing quite well from selling and guiding in sapa, as she had a "big" house and was in the middle of building a toilet in a separate building (a luxury pans house definitely did not have). Pan made sure I knew what to expect from her house when I got there, so that there would not be any surprises. She said I could either stay at a home stay (where most tourists stay) or in her house but that her house was very basic and not nice. 
We got to pans house at about 3 or so, and pan and her husband went to get food from the market for dinner. She lives about 20 seconds from a large beautiful waterfall, in a small simple wooden house. While pan went out I wandered around the area and to the waterfall to relax for a while. Pans husband's little brother about 7 or 8 years old started tagging along with me. While we were sitting on a big rock in the waterfall he took out some marbles and we played for a little while. He didn't speak a word of English, as hmong kids don't learn English until high school. Whenever a marble would roll off the rock and into the waterfall he would let out a worried sound and eagerly jump into the water to collect it. 
After a while I gestured that we should head up the Mountain, and we started walking. We got to a large open area where we sat down and played marbles for a while longer.

It was getting kind of late so I guestured that we head back down the to the house, but he started heading up towards a buffalo about 40m up the mountain. They were blocking a small trail that lead sideways around the mountain which I figured he wanted to walk along. The trail was too thin to walk with a buffalo in the way, but luckily the kid knew what he was doing and was hissing and throwing rocks near the buffalo to make him walk down the trail. We walked about 15m down this trail and 2 more buffalo and a goat appeared from the shrub. I was really apprehensive and kept gesturing the we go back the other way and down the mountain, I didn't like the look of 3 giant buffalo blocking the trail, earlier I had asked pan if buffalo are dangerous and she said some where and some where not.

Somehow the kid managed to move the buffalo up the slope and get around them. but at this point they were between me and the  boy and they started moving towards me, I was genuinely terrified and stepped off the trail down the slope of the mountain a little bit, just enough for the buffalo to walk along the trail. We headed back in the direction we came, with the buffalo in front of us now. Once they were out of the small trail I thought we would walk around them and back to the house, but the boy kept moving the buffalo down the mountain with us using sounds and rocks.

As we got closer to the house I was worried that the buffalo may damage something, but the boy continued to lead them towards the house. In fact all the way to the doorstep of the house where he put the 3 buffalo into their pen, and the goat into its own pen. It was clear now that these buffalo belong to the family and they use them to plow the rice fields, the boy was simply hearding them back home. 
We had pho noodles, beans, tomato and rice for dinner with pans husband and family (the boy, father, grandmother and grandfather) afterward we sat around the fire while the father and grandad drank rice wine and smoked tobacco bongs and the women sewed. A genuinely amazing and unforgettable day.
